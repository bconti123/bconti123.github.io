post: Partial Week AWS

---

November 26 to November 27

I returned in school from sickness. We discussed the AWS and Tableau. Steven explained about small server and to reduce the cost in AWS. Test small server and check how it is running and does work or not. Steven drew stretch paper to show it to us about AWS and Tableau. We will need testing and implement AWS server before we finalize the correct server with resource.  
Finally, I am getting better in health issues. A lot of challenge on the project team because I am very behind. I will try catch up with it! I need to work more hours in senior design class since I worked 3-5 hours a week. I need more than 5 hours to contribute team.
