post: The Final Week

---

December 9-10

We discussed the plan during the break before Spring Semester. We should research, study, and practice AWS for spring semester. We still learn more about AWS and Tableau. We will work on studying AWS for certification exam. Maybe we will have 2 different certifications: Cloud Practioner and Associate Level before spring semester ends. The certification is more impressive to the company that they would hire you.

What I learned from fall semester. The team meeting communicates with each other through slack. JIRA board and github are useful for the future. New things are always be learning by researching the internet, lecture, book, and studentsâ€™ idea. Be prepare and work with team to develop project. The contribution work is important because to make sure everyone is equal as work on project. Social loafer is not good causing the project delay and mess up with it, so social loafer  always waste our time. Senior Design class gives great opportunity for finding future job , to gain experience, and to make good interview about what we did project in class. It will increase chance to get hired by the company.
