post: Research AWS

---
November 4 to November 7

We are doing research on AWS and Tableau. I didn’t finish watching AWS training in three modules. I am learning slowly on it. I don’t like small subtitle because It is too tiny for me. I didn’t have much information. I didn’t do contribution work in a week because I struggled to keep healthy. I can’t make it for Sprint meeting, due to stomach pain.  I am too behind right now.
