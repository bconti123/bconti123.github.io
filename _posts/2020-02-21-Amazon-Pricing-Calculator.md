post: AWS Pricing calculator

---

February 17, 2020 to February 20, 2020

In senior project class. I was focus on all reserved instances to overlook AWS pricing calculator. I didnâ€™t understand what 12 reservation options in each reserved instance type are. I research what are those. Reservation terms are 1 year and 3 years. I think 3 years term is cheaper than 1 year but must paying monthly cost in 3 years before change payment option. My team and I are working on spot instance, on-demand instance, and reserved instance in spreadsheet/excel. They are focus on spot instance and on-demand instance. I asked my team, what do I do with reservation option. I thought checking price for reserved instance is a lot of work on spreadsheet for me. I keep typing out spreadsheet and check the price. I almost finish spreadsheet.
