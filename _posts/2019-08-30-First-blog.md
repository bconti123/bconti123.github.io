post: first blog!

---
This is my first blog! I learned lot about docker and Jekyll. It is very diffcult for me to create this website. I have to do work with group in CIT480 + COMP490 class, work as IT student assistant, and finish weekly blog. That is too much for me.

In CIT480+COMP490 class, I learned many from group about the skills and discussion about "Pet missing". Mapping day 1, Sketching day 2, and Decide day 3 in first week are worth to be learned. I was nervous and discussed with team. I tried do my best by giving out ideas. We will make project, "Pet missing". It is really fun.
