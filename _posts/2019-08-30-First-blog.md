post: first blog!

---
This is my first blog! I learned lot about docker and Jekyll. It is very diffcult for me to create this website. I have to do work with group in CIT480 + COMP490 class, work as IT student assistant, and finish weekly blog. That is too much for me.

In CIT480+COMP490 class, I learned many from group about the skills and discussion about "Pet missing". Mapping day 1, Sketching day 2, and Decide day 3 in first week are worth to be learned. I was nervous and discussed with team. I tried do my best by giving out ideas. We will make project, "Pet missing". It is really fun.

I learned about the docker. I researched lot on it. According to the instruction, Docker allows me to build and to maintain containers either on a remote server or on your local desktop. That is very cool! I would be able to run Docker to have containers on local desktop. For example, I created CIT160 and started it. I can log on with <USER> and maintain files. I will practice with Docker more!

I have problem with the instruction. “Step 3-4: Configure your account within your the CIT160 container” needs to be improved. I am using docker and powershell on my computer. I typed out “chown bryant:bryant /mnt/laptop-cit160”, then docker stop cit160, docker start cit160, docker exec -it cit160 login. I logged on with bryant (user). I tried typing out “scp ssh.sandbox.csun.edu:~steve/cit160/etc/profile ./setup”. It doesn’t let me get that. The display showed “Permission denied” in command prompt. I really don’t understand. I tried typing it out again using my csun account. It worked in step 4 to last that I completed it. I am not sure about “bryant” as <USER> by setting up permission with chown and chmod. Or file permission won't let me access with user.
