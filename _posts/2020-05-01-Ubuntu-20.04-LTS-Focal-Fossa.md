Ubuntu 20.04 LTS Focal Fossa is new and has more awesome features and security. Ubuntu 20.04 LTS is the newer Linux operating system The system has more improvement and development. The packages are not completed yet that it is not supported by newer operating system. The algorithm changed to deliver much faster boot time in Ubuntu 20.04. The features are faster boot speeds, improved appearance, fractional scaling setting, and more. Faster boot speeds mean you turn on the machine to open screen faster and save time. Improved appearance is like you can see nice theme, window, folder icon, and screen in Ubuntu desktop. Fractional scaling setting is to set which size bigger or smaller you want. If it is enabled, you can set 125, 150, 175, and 200 that are easy to read screen bigger or smaller. No amazon app nor python 2 in Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. They are not supported anymore! Python 3 package is there in Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. No 32-bit systems for Ubuntu 20.04. Set up and install package that which is not supported, they are not recommended otherwise the machine would get more problem and messed up easily. Wait for update packages that they would be supported by Ubuntu 20.04. If you do not like Ubuntu 20.04 LTS Focal Fossa, you can go back to Ubuntu 19.04 or 18.04.
