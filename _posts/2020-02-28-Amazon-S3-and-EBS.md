post: Amazon S3 and EBS

February 24, 2020 to February 27, 2020

I learned about Amazon S3 from the lecture online. Amazon S3 is Amazon Simple Storage Service. It is to create “Bucket” which that like web-based cloud storage. You can upload anything to Bucket from Amazon EC2 instance in command line. And you can take anything from Bucket to Amazon EC2 instance in command line. Amazon S3 is designed for backup storage online. Amazon S3 and EBS are separated as storage cloud service. They are different storage service. EBS is Amazon Elastic Block Store, an easy to use, high performance block storage service designed for use with Amazon EC2 instances. EBS volume can be attached to Amazon EC2 instance if needed. Amazon S3 is better for backup, easier security, and data control. EBS can automatically scale file system storage up or down. Amazon EC2 instances can access EFS file system located in other AWS regions through VPC peering.

Amazon S3 vs. Amazon EBS on that is an interesting link below:
