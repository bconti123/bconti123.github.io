---
Senior Design group, I learned about new things in AWS command line from member. Boto 3 command that what team member talking about it. I read the link that “Boto is the Amazon Web Services (AWS) SDK for Python. It enables Python developers to create, configure, and manage AWS services, such as EC2 and S3. Boto provides an easy to use, object-oriented API, as well as low-level access to AWS services.” It would make an easy to use and not worry about access issues in AWS. You can modify, configure, and manage AWS S3 and EC2 instance. You could get API as well as low-level access to AWS. Boto 3 installation should be easy to install if instruction is easy to read.
