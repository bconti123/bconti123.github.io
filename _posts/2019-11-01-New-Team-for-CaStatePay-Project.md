October 28, 2019 to October 31, 2019

I was assigned to join team for CAStatePay project. We agreed the team contract and the project requirement. We write down the note and the researching of the define technology: AWS and Tableau. I was watching the AWS training video for certification. I learned about the AWS and Tableau from the notes on Google Drive. I never use JIRA before. I am still learning about it. I registered my account on JIRA board. We learn more about AWS and Tableau then be prepare technology and project for spring semester 2020. I decided to choose AWS in the two options: AWS or Tableau and we agreed which we decide to choose role. Two divided groups into AWS and Tableau group work. That all.
