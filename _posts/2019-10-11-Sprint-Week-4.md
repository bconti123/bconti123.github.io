Sprint Week 4 on October 7 - October 10, 2019

I went to the emergency room in the hospital. I'm suffering from pain and vomiting for a week now due to some stomach problem. My doctor asked me to stay at home for a few days. I cannot work on our project with the team. I told my team that I am sick.
