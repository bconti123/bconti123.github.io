<a href=”https://www.wix.com/”>Wix</a> is a cloud-based website builder platform including web hosting and design services. I volunteered to work as a website coordinator for two years for a non-profit organization. I enjoyed learning Wix to how to use drag-and-drop tools on layouts and then publishing a website. It is no code development or little code development. That is good for graphic and web designers who don’t want to type code or do not have time to create their websites. Developers tend to rely on their coding skills to make security better in deployment and development. They do not rely on their design skills. There are <a href=”https://www.wix.com/website/templates”>Wix website templates</a> that will save your time in creating your website. 

Is Wix a free-to-use service? No, it is not free, but you can try out 14 days trial before canceling your account or paying <a href=”https://www.wix.com/upgrade/website”>premium plans</a>. You would pay $16/month, $22/month, $27/month, or $45/month to maintain a website in Wix. You can look over <a href=”https://www.wix.com/upgrade/website”>premium plan pricing</a> on Wix’s website. Also, they provide help desk content to resolve your problems with websites. You can open a ticket in your problems of website, account, billing, or many services to request a callback from the support team via phone call or web-based chat. 

I choose AI Company and give a few examples of what I want to drag-and-drop click on my website ideas.

I want to change the company's name. Use drag and drop tool by using your mouse in pointing at the text in the edit site at Wix.

I helped out the community with my web developer skills. I looked over site sessions, total sales, and post views in Wix Analytics.

Wix provided backend and frontend without coding skills. Without tech knowledge? There are Wix customer service can help you to design a website with email, chat, or phone calls. Graphic/Web Designers should try Wix. It is nice to have new skills! Don't worry about coding skills. I am not a Web Designer because I am not great at designing skills. I rather use my coding skills. If you need help with complicated coding in Wix, ask your friends or hire Web developers.
