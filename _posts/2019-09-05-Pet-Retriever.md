We were discussed, worked on web app project, and communicated through slack and in class. I learned how to work with group and research front-end and css. It is harder to create best one for me but I did try my best. I should have more time on working web app project if I don’t have part-time job. Time management is difficult for me. I practiced git for clone, commit, checkout branch, pull and push repository. I was scared the web app project that it would screw up. I don’t know how to git in command prompt, although, I still learn more about git in command prompt. Failure can be turned into successful work. I shouldn’t afraid of failure. My group asked me can do CSS styling on web app project. I told them I am not good at CSS styling. I did learn CSS from COMP484. I should be willing to work CSS styling, so my skill would be improved and to become better. I learned lesson about not scared of work on project and keep learning front-end and CSS styling. “Can’t do it” is to not help the group and not enough contribute project. I learned git from Joshua. He showed me how git in command prompt and run vue.js in command prompt. Next time, I will learn more from group. I was nervous and not ready for presentation. The presentation took longer. I think the coding slides are not needed because it could kill time.
