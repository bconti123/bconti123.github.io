Sprint Week 3 on September 30

I am sick this week. I missed CIT480+COMP490 class on Monday and Thursday. I did let team know I am sick through Slack. I wanted to make sure we still continue work on our project. I've struggled Vue project and git practice. When I read Trello organizer, I didn't know what I do with the project. I asked my team, what do we do with our project. I was told that we just set up Vue files but no functions on class search project. Dong Wang did create Vue project himself without functions and prepare to be ready and make divide work on the functions of class search. I can't keep healthy nor feel better and have personal issues. I am overwhelmed on team project and feel not comfortable because I can't stop thinking about my personal issues. I have difficult time working on school and hard to focus on homework and project. Future work with personal issues is not easy for me. Personal and work supposed to be separated! Personal can causes the business will be messed up and possibly shut down because of influence is not good for team. I did little contribute work and have lack leadership because I was scared of communicate with team. Personal need be forgettable. That might better than sorry.

I will try keep healthy, more contribute work, and communicate with team. Be brave and keep work.
