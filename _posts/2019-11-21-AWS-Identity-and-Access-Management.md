post: IAM setup

---

November 18 to November 21, 2019

We did set up IAM username and to use same account ID for preparing AWS set up and Tableau installation. We share the instance and storage in same account ID using our own IAM username. IAM is AWS Identity and Access Management to help us control who is authenticated and authorized to use resources. I talked about IAM set up in the team meeting last week. Now we figured it out. 
I had a fever and was very sick this week. I didnâ€™t attend the CIT480/COMP490 class on Tuesday to Thursday, due to the health issues I went to the Emergency Room. I was suffering from knee pain and fever. I am not be able to walk this week. My knee pain got worse.
