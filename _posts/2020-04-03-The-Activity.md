Elastic Beanstalk activity is very interesting and worth learning. You can upload code like Java, NET, PHP, Node.js, Python, Go, Ruby, and Docker with familiar servers as Apache, Nglnx, Passenger, and IIS. Elastic Beanstalk handles the deployment, from load balancing and auto scaling to application health monitoring. Retaining full control over AWS resources powering application and can access the resource any time. Elastic Beanstalk is free and no charge cost. Elastic Beanstalkâ€™s benefits are fast and simple to begin, developer productivity, complete resource control and impossible to outgrow.

I am learning other thing called Ceph file system from advanced CIT class. It is an open source software storage for Linux. Ceph file system offers features compared to many object storage systems available. It provides a traditional file system interface with POSIX semantics. POSIX is Portable Operating System Interface as Linux system. The physical server is old and uses Ceph file system. A storage requirements grow for legacy applications. Professional IT can configure their legacy application to use the Ceph file system tool. Ceph is to ensure high performance and prevents heavy loads on specific host within the cluster.
