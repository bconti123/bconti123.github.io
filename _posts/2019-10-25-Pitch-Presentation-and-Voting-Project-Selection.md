post: Pitch Presentation and Voting Project Selection

---

October 21, 2019 to October 24, 2019

There was no blog last week, due to health issues. I returned in the school from sick for 2 weeks. I am not ready for class. I am not full healthy now. I talked with professors on the solution about catch up with the assignment what I missed. I am very behind from 2 weeks ago. I try catch up with CIT480 class. I don't have to pitch presentation because I am not chosen last week. I updated resume for that the project team will look the resume and choose member. I learned a lot from some students' pitch presentation.
