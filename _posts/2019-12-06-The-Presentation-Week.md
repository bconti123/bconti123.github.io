post: The Presentation Week

---

December 2 to December 5, 2019

The presentation week, I watched the presentation on Monday and Wednesday. I didn’t show up on Tuesday and Thursday due to health issues. I wasn’t be prepared to help my team making the presentation because I missed some days last week. I worked as researching AWS and Tableau in class with team. No show up for the presentation week is very unprofessional. In my thought, if teams don’t show up while one presents the project, demo live, plan, and resource in the business, so the empty audience is not helping and supporting the presenter to ruin the project plan. Everyone should show up and supports the presenter to make better business. I learned a lot from the presentation and explaining the project, plan, and resource. It is very important for the future and when I get hired from the company what do I do with the presentation.
