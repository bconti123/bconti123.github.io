Project #2

DevOps teams are to be formed. I got a new team and assigned product A. It is related to the CSUN class search app. This week 1 will do Venture Sprint Design, Selection of Tools, Selection of Processes, Scheduling of Ceremonies, Definition of Done, and Team Agreement. My team and I practiced and discussed this week. I am not used with a new team. I meet new team members and don’t know who they are.

Team Agreement, we made rules and agree what’s time we arrive in class and set up a meeting. Nobody wants to be Scrum Master. Someone needs to be Scrum Master in each week. We have 3 weeks. 1 scrum master and 1 co-scrum master per week. We decided the roles. I will do IT with Nury. I will learn more in IT with him. We discussed the Selection of processes and Scheduling of ceremonies. Every class session on between Monday and Thursday at 9:30 am.

I missed class yesterday because I am sick. I cannot attend school. I wanted to know how’s team and communicated via slack. I made sure we did finish the tasks.
