post: Research AWS and Tableau

---

November 11 to November 14

I watched AWS training in all modules. I tried to set up AWS practice myself. It is very challenge set up for me. I returned in school on November 12. My group and I discussed about the budget on AWS and Tableau. The pre-installation set up has the requirement is how depend on AWS instance type and size. We need Tableau license, and AWS instance type and size. If we want higher CPU and higher RAM, we need to pay AWS billing for running instance in like one month. If AWS bill estimates $1.50 per hour, I would say $1,000.00+ per month. It is too much. We need to make request for AWS instance and type plus Tableau license, then give the information about the AWS and Tableau to IT Support for approval before pay to receive AWS and Tableau.

After I watched AWS training, I am not sure what do we do with Tableau and AWS. My team and I discussed about creating AWS account for us. We still working and researching on AWS account. My team might use my AWS account, $100 credit from AWS educate program. I never use the credit in AWS. How we use one AWS account at the same time is still vague to me. I would suggest IAM user and group from what I watch AWS training video.

Team Weekly Work

I don’t have much contribution work and worked like 5-10 hours this week. I need to research and show what’s best for AWS and Tableau on slack with team. The information can help us to set up AWS and Tableau.
