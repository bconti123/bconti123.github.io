post: Time Tracker Software
---

<h3>Why should I keep tracking my coding time daily using time tracker software?</h3>
I lack habits, time management, and coding skills as a Web Developer/Software Developer. A time tracker software called WakaTime is free to use the software. It helps to improve programmers' routines, ensuring they don't skip coding days and continue work in a minimum hour. A dashboard displays that to see how much spent time on coding today and yesterday. Use makeup and programming languages often while WakaTime monitors you to see how many minutes and hours you work on various projects. 

I found WakaTime by looking up inspirational blogs that can change life to support mental health because that affects mindset and attitude to keep motivation longer. Read various blogs and books daily to improve vocabulary and critical thinking skills. No pain, no gain, if not working hard. Don't be depressed. Keep positive! Maybe an hour coding, 30 minutes reading books, and 30 minutes reading blogs? To expand picture ideas wider and to see the world and understand better. Time tracker software helped tech blog writers. They recommended using that.

To understand how they feel about routine life, Learn about their routines and mistakes that will improve your life and break bad habits. Practice makes perfect and accepts your mistakes. It is part of the learning routine. I will work hard and overcome my mistakes and bad habits. I hope my time management skill will help me. I will write a blog post again every Friday.
